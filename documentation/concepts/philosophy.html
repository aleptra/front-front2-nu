  <p margintop="1rem">
    Front embraces a declarative, low-code philosophy that simplifies development by unifying structure, behavior, and styling into a clear, coherent workflow.
  </p>

  <section margintop="2rem">
    <h2 margintop="2rem" color="white">Origin Story</h2>
    <p>
      The spark for Front and FTML was ignited in 2019 by Josef Gabrielsson. Existing frameworks had become fragmented, requiring a dizzying array of files even for simple tasks. This exploration evolved into a low-code vision: reduce the code developers must orchestrate manually and express intent directly through structured markup.
    </p>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      At the time, the industry was deep into the "separation of concerns" dogma. Proposing a way to program directly within markup was often met with skepticism.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section margintop="2rem">
    <h2 margintop="2rem" color="white">The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a new paradigm meant overcoming friction and the "mental tax" of context switching and technical complexity, refined over years of experimentation before public release.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section margintop="2rem">
    <h2 margintop="2rem" color="white">The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Front and FTML form a declarative, unified framework where markup is the authoritative source of truth, weaving structure, behavior, and styling into a single coherent thread.
    </p>
    <ul margintop="1rem" class="list">
      <li marginbottom="0.5rem"><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Reduce boilerplate and unnecessary files.</li>
      <li marginbottom="0.5rem"><strong>Clarity:</strong> Intent is visible directly in markup.</li>
      <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> Teams focus on delivering value rather than wrestling with technical overhead.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section margintop="2rem">
    <h2 margintop="2rem" color="white">A Different Mental Model</h2>
    <p>
      Front shifts how interfaces are conceived: instead of assembling behavior step by step, developers describe what elements are and how they behave, letting the framework interpret intent.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section margintop="2rem">
    <h2 margintop="2rem" color="white">Reducing Cognitive Load</h2>
    <p>
      By keeping structure, behavior, and layout together, Front minimizes context switching and fragmented abstractions, letting developers reason about interfaces more intuitively.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section margintop="2rem">
    <h2 margintop="2rem" color="white">Pragmatism Over Purity</h2>
    <p>
      Front favors practical cohesion over strict separation between technologies, organizing concerns around clarity and outcomes rather than file type.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section margintop="2rem">
    <h2 margintop="2rem" color="white">Tooling Should Fade Into the Background</h2>
    <p>
      The framework aims to feel almost invisible, removing ceremony and heavy setup so that focus remains on the application itself.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section margintop="2rem">
    <h2 margintop="2rem" color="white">The Guiding Idea</h2>
    <p>
      Developing for the web should feel closer to composing a document than engineering a machine. By collapsing unnecessary layers and emphasizing declarative expression, Front restores a direct path between intention and implementation.
