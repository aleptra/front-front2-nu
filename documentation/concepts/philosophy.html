  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <p margintop="2rem">
    The project began in 2019 by Josef Gabrielsson to address the growing complexity of interface
    development across platforms. From the beginning, the idea of expressing application behavior directly in markup was
    met with skepticism. Many questioned whether markup could responsibly handle concerns traditionally reserved for
    imperative code. To ensure the paradigm was sound, the project remained closed for several years while the
    declarative model was explored, stress-tested, and refined before its public release.

  <!-- THE CHALLENGE -->

    <p margintop="1rem">
      Traditional approaches introduced mental overhead through layered abstractions and rigid structures. Logic,
      styling, and data were separated across contexts, forcing developers to shift syntaxes to express a single idea. A
      single interaction often had to be translated between multiple conceptual layers. This fragmentation obscured
      intent and made interfaces harder to reason about.

    <p margintop="1rem">
      Front is guided by enduring values of simplicity, clarity, and predictability. The language reduces cognitive
      overhead, enabling developers to focus on intent rather than translation across layers. Interfaces are designed
      to be composable, consistent, and immediately understandable, and logic remains concise and close to the markup.
    </p>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      At its core, Front embraces declarative thinking: expressing <i>what</i> should happen rather than <i>how</i>.
      This philosophy ensures that interfaces remain predictable and coherent across platforms, and that developers can
      reason easily about their structure and behavior.
    </p>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      Looking forward, Front aspires to be a “thought language” for both humans and AI. By following the same principles
      of composability, clarity, and predictability, AI agents can generate Front markup directly, aligning with the
      mental model of human developers and unifying intent, reasoning, and execution seamlessly.
