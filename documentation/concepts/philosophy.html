  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <p margintop="1rem">
    The project began in 2019 by Josef Gabrielsson to address the growing complexity of interface
    development across platforms. From the beginning, the idea of expressing application behavior directly in markup was
    met with skepticism. Many questioned whether markup could responsibly handle concerns traditionally reserved for
    imperative code. To ensure the paradigm was sound, the project remained closed for several years while the
    declarative model was explored, stress-tested, and refined before its public release.

  <!-- THE CHALLENGE -->

    <h2 color="white">The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional approaches introduced mental overhead through layered abstractions and rigid structures. Logic,
      styling, and data were separated across contexts, forcing developers to shift syntaxes to express a single idea. A
      single interaction often had to be translated between multiple conceptual layers. This fragmentation obscured
      intent and made interfaces harder to reason about.

  <!-- CORE PRINCIPLES -->
  <section margintop="3rem">
    <h2 color="white">Core Principles</h2>
    <ul marginleft="1rem" class="list">
      <li><b>Declarative:</b> Describe what happens, not how; the runtime handles it.</li>
      <li><b>Markup as Runtime:</b> Markup expresses structure, behavior, and styling directly.</li>
      <li><b>Predictable:</b> Actions occur in order, making interfaces easy to reason about.</li>
      <li><b>Minimal Ceremony:</b> Works immediately without build steps or complex toolchains.</li>
      <li><b>Clarity:</b> Logic and structure prioritize comprehension over patterns.</li>
      <li><b>Extensible:</b> Modules and plugins add behavior without complexity.</li>
      <li><b>Minimal Logic:</b> Logic stays concise and close to markup.</li>
      <li><b>Universal:</b> Compatible across platforms while enhancing markup.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- A DIFFERENT MENTAL MODEL -->
  <section margintop="3rem">
    <h2 color="white">A Different Mental Model</h2>
    <p>
      In Front, each attribute expresses a small unit of behavior. Together, they form a graph describing the interface.
      Developers focus on <b>intent</b> rather than components or lifecycle, thinking in terms like:
    </p>
    <ul marginleft="1rem" margintop="1rem" class="list">
      <li>"This should load data."</li>
      <li>"This should react when a value changes."</li>
      <li>"This should appear conditionally."</li>
      <li>"This should map to a global value."</li>
      <li>"This should repeat for each item."</li>
    </ul>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      This mental model simplifies reasoning and makes interfaces self-describing, enabling a direct path from intent to
      implementation.
