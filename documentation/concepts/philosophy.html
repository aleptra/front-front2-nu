  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <p margintop="1rem">
    Front, powered by FTML, is built on a declarative, low-code, markup-first philosophy that unifies structure,
    behavior,
    styling, and data. Developers focus on <b>what the interface should express</b>, while the runtime handles details
    seamlessly.
  </p>

  <!-- ORIGIN STORY -->
  <section margintop="3rem">
    <h2 color="white">Origin Story</h2>
    <p>
      Front and FTML began in 2019 by Josef Gabrielsson to address growing complexity in interface development across
      platforms. Traditional frameworks scattered logic and styling across multiple layers, obscuring the core goal: to
      build interfaces. The project was intentionally kept closed for several years while the declarative paradigm was
      explored and validated, allowing the approach to mature before being released publicly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- THE CHALLENGE -->
  <section margintop="3rem">
    <h2 color="white">The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional approaches imposed mental overhead through scattered abstractions, rigid structures, and unnecessary
      steps. Logic, styling, and data handling were often separated across multiple layers, requiring developers to move
      between different syntaxes and contexts to express a single idea. Developers were forced to translate intent into
      framework-specific patterns and boilerplate. This fragmentation reduced clarity, increased context-switching, and
      made even simple interfaces harder to reason about and maintain.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- THE SOLUTION -->
  <section margintop="3rem">
    <h2 color="white">The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Front introduces a new paradigm in interface development: a declarative, low-code approach that unifies structure,
      behavior, styling, and data.
      It minimizes friction, making interfaces intuitive and approachable while remaining powerful.
    </p>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      Front provides a declarative framework where markup is the authoritative source of truth.
      Every element expresses intent, forming a cohesive, self-describing runtime.
    </p>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      Guided by a modular, declarative philosophy, components and plugins manage responsibilities,
      letting developers focus on high-level design and creating clear, coherent experiences.
    </p>

    <!-- CORE PRINCIPLES -->
    <h3 color="white" margintop="2rem">Foundational Pillars</h3>

    <h5 marginleft="1rem" margintop="2rem" color="white">1. Declarative Expression</h5>
    <p marginleft="1rem">
      Developers describe <i>what should happen</i>, not <i>how</i>. The runtime interprets intent automatically.
    </p>

    <h5 marginleft="1rem" margintop="2rem" color="white">2. Markup as the Runtime</h5>
    <p marginleft="1rem">
      Markup serves as the expressive surface for declarative structure, behavior, and styling across platforms, letting
      developers build interfaces directly in markup without writing JavaScript or CSS.
    </p>

    <h5 marginleft="1rem" margintop="2rem" color="white">3. Predictable and Reversible</h5>
    <p marginleft="1rem">
      Actions occur in a clear, deterministic order, preserving clarity and making the interface easy to reason about.
    </p>

    <h5 marginleft="1rem" margintop="2rem" color="white">4. Minimal Ceremony</h5>
    <p marginleft="1rem">
      No toolchains or compilation are required. Interfaces work immediately in any environment.
    </p>

    <h5 marginleft="1rem" margintop="2rem" color="white">5. Pragmatic Clarity</h5>
    <p marginleft="1rem">
      Understanding is prioritized over rigid patterns. Logic is placed where it enhances comprehension.
    </p>

    <h5 marginleft="1rem" margintop="2rem" color="white">6. Extensible Simplicity</h5>
    <p marginleft="1rem">
      Modules and plugins extend behavior without adding complexity, keeping the runtime transparent and approachable.
    </p>

    <h5 marginleft="1rem" margintop="2rem" color="white">7. Minimalistic Logic</h5>
    <p marginleft="1rem">
      Logic is kept concise and close to the markup it affects, avoiding unnecessary abstraction.
    </p>

    <h5 marginleft="1rem" margintop="2rem" color="white">8. Universal Compatibility</h5>
    <p marginleft="1rem">
      Works reliably across platforms while enhancing markup rather than replacing it.
    </p>

  <!-- A DIFFERENT MENTAL MODEL -->
  <section margintop="3rem">
    <h2 color="white">A Different Mental Model</h2>
    <p>
      In Front, each attribute expresses a small unit of behavior. Together, they form a declarative graph
      describing the interface. Developers think in terms of <b>intent</b> rather than components or lifecycle.
    </p>
    <ul marginleft="1rem" margintop="1rem" class="list">
      <li>"This should load data."</li>
      <li>"This should react when a value changes."</li>
      <li>"This should appear conditionally."</li>
      <li>"This should map to a global value."</li>
      <li>"This should repeat for each item."</li>
    </ul>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      This mental model simplifies reasoning and makes interfaces self-describing.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- THE GUIDING IDEA -->
  <section margintop="3rem">
    <h2 color="white">The Guiding Idea</h2>
    <p>
      Building interfaces should feel like crafting a document, not assembling a machine.
    </p>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      By collapsing unnecessary layers and embracing declarative expression, Front creates a direct path from intent to
      implementation. Developers write markup that communicates meaning, which the runtime interprets seamlessly.
    </p>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      The result is a framework that is powerful yet approachable, clear, and aligned with the principles of intuitive,
      declarative interface design.
