      The idea for Front and FTML first took shape in 2019 by me, Josef Gabrielsson, while at work. I found myself
      increasingly frustrated with existing frameworks that often felt overly complicated. They required numerous files
      even for the simplest tasks, making maintenance and deployment more cumbersome than necessary.
    </p>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      Motivated by these challenges, I spent years experimenting to find a solution. Through this process, I designed a
      new paradigm aimed at simplifying development. This initial design sought to unify different aspects of web
      development into a more streamlined approach. However, it remained a personal project and was never released
      publicly.
    </p>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      At the time, many people were skeptical about programming directly with markup. This approach challenged
      conventional methods and the established expectations of web development workflows.
    </p>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      This journey ultimately led to the creation of Front and FTML, which embody a declarative and unified approach to
      building web interfaces. The core philosophy integrates structure, behavior, and styling directly within the
      markup. I also chose ECMA5 as the JavaScript target to ensure compatibility with older browsers and to avoid
      relying on polyfills. By doing so, development becomes simpler, more maintainable, and more efficient, eliminating
      the need to juggle multiple separate files and tools.
    </p>
    <p margintop="1rem">
      With Front and FTML, developers can declare dynamic behavior, data binding, and interactivity clearly and
      concisely. This fosters a more intuitive and productive experience that addresses the complexities I originally
      encountered.
