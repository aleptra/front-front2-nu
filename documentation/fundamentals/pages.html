    <p>A Page represents a structured, self-contained view of your application. Pages act as containers for elements,
      layouts, and FTML attributes, defining how content is presented, styled, and behaves. They are the building blocks
      of your applications, allowing you to organize your app into logical sections or screens. Pages can be of
      different types depending on their purpose, providing modular and reusable views tailored to specific sections,
      features, or workflows within your application.</p>

    <p>
      A Start Page is a specialized page that serves as the entry point for your application. It is loaded first and
      sets up global configurations, scripts, styles, and layout structures that other Standard Pages may rely on.</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Load core attributes, modules, plugins and assets.</li>

  <section color="silver">
    <p>
      A Standard Page is a flexible page that builds upon the base structure of your application. It can override
      elements, layouts, or attributes defined in a StartPage, allowing you to customize the content, style, and
      behavior for specific sections or workflows. Standard Pages act as containers for elements, layouts, and FTML
      attributes, providing modular and reusable views that help organize your application into logical sections or
      screens.</p>

    <h3 zoom="0.7" color="white" padding="2rem 0 1rem 0">Key Responsibilities:</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Inherit and optionally override elements, layouts, and configurations from the Start Page.</li>
      <li>Organize and present content specific to a section, feature, or workflow.</li>
      <li>Ensure consistency with the applicationâ€™s overall structure and style.</li>
